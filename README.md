## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanila JS




### What I learned

- Set ```pointer-events:none``` to prevent the element from becoming the target of pointer events

```css
.disabled {
  pointer-events: none;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
